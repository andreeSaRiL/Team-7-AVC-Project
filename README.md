Welcome to the team 7 GitHUb , All files with relation to the AVC project are located on here !

14th May:	Our first lab, introduced each other, completed our Project plan, allocated roles, milestones, hardware check and signed the team agreement.

16th May:	The second lab we met up and started with building the robot (hardware) and the programmer continued coding and making progress. Started creating a model to 3D print, sketching and discussing ideas of the structure of the robot. 

21st May:	We began the testing for Quadrant 2, due to difficulty of connecting to the network so it could be done remotely. The First Test with code was quite successful as the camera managed to detect (detects black) the lines if they’re present or not. Before we tested with the code, we plugged the cables on the robot, and noticed that the left wheel moved backwards (even though there was nothing on the raspberry pi, the program hasn’t run), as well as the right wheel did not turn. However, we have managed to adjust the motors but the values of the adjustments were off and was given an error value. The Raspberry PI kept rattling during the testing.  

22nd May:	During this lab we are trying to remotely connect/code the raspberry pi. There was a problem with the robustness of the robot. While in the box, the hot glued camera was removed from the robot (may need to reposition the camera somewhere else so another problem won’t occur). Raspberry PI not screwed on properly, one of the wheels were removed as well meaning that further testing will deteriorate the hot glue on the wheel. We removed the leftover glue from the robot. Testing how to remotely connect and run program, testing how to compile on own laptop (we should now be able to run it remotely now). 

Successfully completed Quadrant 1, gate opening (done remotely). We screwed the raspberry pi tightly and are now including bolts to keep it secure. We sanded the camera’s plastic body so the hot glue has something to adhere to. The wheels have been re-glued using the same technique of sanding and gluing for extra adherence. We have finalised the robot’s exterior. The shell still needs to be made through 3D printing to cover. We are currently using a badge for the robot to turn as a test run but may use a marble for final decision. 

28th & 29th May:	Working on Quadrant 2 and Quadrant 3, so code will continue working. Both wheels working. Remodelled robot so that the parts are more robust and tightly secured. First build of robot, we used hot glue doing this would’ve cost us marks, since the parts we use should be able to be reuse them. With our new model, we discussed it once more whether we should use a marble or the DELL badge that we previously chose, we finally made the choice to go back to our first idea and use the marble. 

30th & 31st May:	After the agreement of the new model for the robot we assembled it and got it tested and ran, however we had to reassemble it due to loose screws and wobbly wheels. Successfully completed Quadrant 3, even though it was more due to luck and chance as we tested it a numerous amount of times and even then, the team always went back to the code and reworked it so that the robot is able to complete Quadrant 3 with less errors. Received preliminary grade of 78% from Arthur, the team was very pleased with this and pushed ourselves so that the robot would be able to get 80% (complete Quadrant 3) for the proper and final testing.
